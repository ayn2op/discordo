Discordo is a lightweight, secure, and feature-rich Discord terminal client.  

## Warning

Automated user accounts or "self-bots" are against Discord's Terms of Service. I am not responsible for any loss caused by using "self-bots" or Discordo.

## Authentification

There are two ways to login:  
> In both cases, the authentication token is stored securely in the default OS-specific keyring.

**Username / Password login**

1. Run `discordo` without arguments.  
2. Enter your email and password then click on the "Login" button to continue.

**Token login**

Use the `--token` flag:

```
discordo --token "OTI2MDU5NTQxNDE2Nzc5ODA2.Yc2KKA.2iZ-5JxgxG-9Ub8GHzBSn-NJjNg"
```

## Configuration

The configuration file allows you to edit keybindings or change the theme.
By default, it is stored in the following location:

| Operating System | Configuration File Location                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unix             | `$HOME/.config/discordo/config.yml`                     |
| Darwin           | `$HOME/Library/Application Support/discordo/config.yml` |
| Windows          | `%AppData%/discordo/config.yml`                         |

You can also use the `--config` flag to specify a different location for the configuration file:

```
discordo --config "/foo/bar/config.yml"
```


## Log files

The log file is stored in the following location:

| Operating System | Log File Location                        |
