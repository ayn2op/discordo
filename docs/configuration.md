# Configuration

The configuration file allows you to configure and customize the behavior, keybindings, and theme of the application. It is automatically created on first start-up at the following location:

- Unix: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/discordo/config.yml` or `$HOME/.config/discordo/config.yml`
- Darwin: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/discordo/config.yml`
- Windows: `%AppData%/discordo/config.yml`
