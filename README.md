## Features

- **Lightweight**: Designed to have a low memory footprint and low CPU usage, overall a low usage of system resources.
- **Secure**: Securely stores the authentication token on first login in an OS-specific keyring file.

## Installation

### Building from Source

- Run the following commands in chronological order.

```
git clone https://github.com/rigormorrtiss/discordo
cd discordo && go build
```

## Getting Started

- Run the built executable in a new Terminal.
- Choose the preferred login method.
- Log in using the chosen login method and click on "Login" button to continue.
Note: bot accounts tokens must be prefixed with "Bot " (eg: "Bot ODM9NjU5MDAqNjQyOFYoNDM4.YU-UQw.vBefI1uO0q6QGKDSQ2iUk5z8PY4").
