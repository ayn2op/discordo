## Installation

## Prebuilt binaries

You can download and install a [prebuilt binary here](https://nightly.link/ayntgl/discordo/workflows/ci/main) for Windows, macOS, or Linux.

### Package managers

- [Arch Linux](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/discordo-git/): `yay -S discordo-git` (thanks to [Alyxia Sother](https://github.com/lexisother) for maintaining the AUR package).

### Building from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayntgl/discordo
cd discordo
make build

# optional
sudo mv ./discordo /usr/local/bin
```

### Linux clipboard support

- `xclip` or `xsel` for X11.
  - Ubuntu: `apt install xclip`
  - Arch Linux: `pacman -S xclip`
  - Fedora: `dnf install xclip`
- `wl-clipboard` for Wayland.
  - Ubuntu: `apt install wl-clipboard`
  - Arch Linux: `pacman -S wl-clipboard`
  - Fedora: `dnf install wl-clipboard`

## Usage

- Run the `discordo` executable with no arguments.

- Log in using the account email and password (first-time login) and click on the "Login" button to continue.

  - If you are using a bot account to login, set the `DISCORDO_TOKEN` environment variable to the token of the bot and prefix it with `Bot ` (eg: `Bot OTI2MDU5NTQxNDE2Nzc5ODA2.Yc2KKA.2iZ-5JxgxG-9Ub8GHzBSn-NJjNg`).

  - By default, Discordo utilizes OS-specific keyring to store the authentication token. However, if you prefer not to use a keyring (not recommended), you may set the `DISCORDO_TOKEN` environment variable and Discordo will prioritize the usage of the provided token to login instead of keyring.

### Configuration

A default configuration file is created on first start-up at `$HOME/.config/discordo/config.toml` on Unix, `$HOME/Library/Application Support/discordo/config.toml` on Darwin, and `%AppData%/discordo/config.toml` on Windows.
