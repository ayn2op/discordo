## Installation

### Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rigormorrtiss/discordo
cd discordo && go build

# optional
sudo mv ./discordo /usr/local/bin
```

## Package managers

```bash
# (AUR) Arch Linux - development version (may be outdated)
yay -S discordo-git
```

## Getting Started

- Run the executable in a new Terminal window.

By default, Discordo utilizes OS-specific keyring to store credentials such as client authentication token. However, if you prefer not to use a keyring, you may set the `token` field in the configuration file (`~/.config/discordo/config.json`) and Discordo will prioritize the usage of `token` field to login instead of keyring. 

- Log in using the email and password (first-time login) and click on the "Login" button to continue.

### Default Keybindings

Global:

- `Alt` + `1`: Sets the focus on the guilds TreeView.
- `Alt` + `2`: Sets the focus on the messages TextView.
- `Alt` + `3`: Sets the focus on the message InputField.

TextView:

- `k` or `Up`: Selects the message just before the currently selected message.
- `j` or `Down`: Selects the message just after the currently selected message.
- `g` or `Home`: Selects the first message rendered in the TextView.
- `G` or `End`: Selects the last message rendered in the TextView.

### Clipboard

- Requires `xclip` or `xsel` for X11.
- Requires `wl-clipboard` for Wayland.
