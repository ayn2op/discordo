## Installation

### Building from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayntgl/discordo
cd discordo
go build

# optional
sudo mv ./discordo /usr/local/bin
```

### Package managers

- Arch Linux (unofficial, AUR, may be outdated): `yay -S discordo-git`

## Usage

- Run the executable in a new Terminal window.

By default, Discordo utilizes OS-specific keyring to store credentials such as client authentication token. However, if you prefer not to use a keyring, you may set the `token` field in the configuration file (`~/.config/discordo/config.json`) and Discordo will prioritize the usage of `token` field to login instead of keyring.

- Log in using the email and password (first-time login) and click on the "Login" button to continue.

### Configuration

Discordo aims to be highly configurable, it may be easily customized via a configuration file. It creates a default configuration file on the first start-up. The newly created configuration file is located at `$HOME/.config/discordo/config.json`.

### Clipboard support

On Linux, clipboard support requires:

- `xclip` or `xsel` for X11.
- `wl-clipboard` for Wayland.
