## Usage

1. Run the `discordo` executable with no arguments.

> If you are logging in using an authentication token, provide the `token` command-line flag to the executable (eg: `--token "OTI2MDU5NTQxNDE2Nzc5ODA2.Yc2KKA.2iZ-5JxgxG-9Ub8GHzBSn-NJjNg"`). The token is stored securely in the default OS-specific keyring.

2. Enter your email and password and click on the "Login" button to continue.
