## Installation

### Building from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayntgl/discordo
cd discordo
go build

# optional
sudo mv ./discordo /usr/local/bin
```

### Package managers

- Arch Linux (unofficial, AUR, may be outdated): `yay -S discordo-git`

## Usage

1. Run the `discordo` executable with no arguments in a new Terminal window.
2. Log in using the account email and password (first-time login) and click on the "Login" button to continue.

> By default, Discordo utilizes OS-specific keyring to store credentials such as client authentication token. However, if you prefer not to use a keyring (not recommended), you may set the `token` field in the configuration file (`~/.config/discordo/config.toml`) and Discordo will prioritize the usage of the provided token to login instead of keyring.

### Configuration

Discordo aims to be highly configurable, it may be easily customized via a configuration file. It creates a default configuration file on the first start-up. The default and newly created configuration file is located at `$HOME/.config/discordo/config.toml`.

### Clipboard support

On Linux, clipboard support requires:

- `xclip` or `xsel` for X11.
- `wl-clipboard` for Wayland.
