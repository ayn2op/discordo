### Prebuilt binaries

You can download and install a [prebuilt binary here](https://nightly.link/ayn2op/discordo/workflows/ci/main) for Windows, macOS, or Linux.

### Package managers

- Arch Linux: `yay -S discordo-git`
- FreeBSD: `pkg install discordo` or via the ports system `make -C /usr/ports/net-im/discordo install clean`.
- NixOS: `nix-shell -p discordo`

### Building from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayn2op/discordo
cd discordo
go build .
```

### Linux clipboard support

- `xclip` or `xsel` for X11 (`apt install xclip`)
- `wl-clipboard` for Wayland (`apt install wl-clipboard`)

## Usage

1. Run the `discordo` executable with no arguments.

> If you are logging in using an authentication token, provide the `token` command-line flag to the executable (eg: `--token "OTI2MDU5NTQxNDE2Nzc5ODA2.Yc2KKA.2iZ-5JxgxG-9Ub8GHzBSn-NJjNg"`). The token is stored securely in the default OS-specific keyring.

2. Enter your email and password and click on the "Login" button to continue.

## Configuration

The configuration file allows you to configure and customize the behavior, keybindings, and theme of the application.

- Darwin: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/discordo/config.yml`
- Windows: `%AppData%/discordo/config.yml`
